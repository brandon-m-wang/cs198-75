            <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
            <p>Welcome to CS198-75! For your first homework, you'll be building out a single-page complete personal portfolio that
                can serve as your own site for showcasing your education, work experience, achievements, and projects using HTML and
                CSS. You can expect the format of all released homeworks here on out to be in this guided doc format. Feel free to
                collaborate with your teammates on this homework, but remember that everyone has to submit their own homework.
            </p>
            <h2 id="project-set-up">Project Set-up</h2>
            <p>For this project (and all projects), you will have a project skeleton to work off of. The skeleton includes some
                JavaScript components, pre-existing styling, and boilerplate code to help you get started. You only need to worry about
                the parts marked with comments corresponding to each part of the homework.
            </p>
            <p>To fetch the skeleton, you will git clone the skeleton repository into your
                <mark>
                    <code>cubstart</code>
                </mark>
                directory. While at your
                <mark>
                    <code>cubstart</code>
                </mark>
                directory,
                            run the following bash command: <pre><code>git clone --depth=1 --branch=master https://github.com/brandon-m-wang/cubstart-hw1-skeleton.git hw1 && rm -rf ./hw1/.git</code></pre>
                You should now see a new
                <mark>
                    <code>hw1</code>
                </mark>
                folder in the directory. Accessing it includes all the
                        contents of the project.
            </p>
            <p>To open this project in VSCode, run this bash command: <pre><code>code hw1</code></pre>
            </p>
            <p>Make sure you have the VSCode Live Server extension installed. To run your site and see changes reflected in
                real-time, right click > Open with Live Server on
                <mark>
                    <code>index.html</code>
                </mark>.</p>
            <h2 id="part-1:-the-document-head">Part 1: The Document Head</h2>
            <p>Access the
                <mark>
                    <code>index.html</code>
                </mark>
                file in the project directory. This is where the layout of your site is; think of it as the skeleton of the
                site.
            </p>
            <p>Recall that the head of the document is where metadata, page information, and important link tags go. You are able to
                link style sheets (your .css files) within the document head, as well as title your page as it shows on your browser
                tab.</p>
            <p>Add a title for your website, and link your stylesheet in the enclosing head tags. The corresponding tags are
                referenced for your convenience.</p>
            <pre><code>&lt;link rel="" href=""&gt;&#13;&lt;title&gt;Your Name&lt;/title&gt;</code></pre>
            <h2 id="part-2:-html-tags-and-attributes">Part 2: HTML Tags and Attributes</h2>
            <p>Here, you'll be creating your logo, which in this example will be your initials. Within the
                <mark>
                    <code>h3</code>
                </mark>
                tags in the problem, you will add an
                <mark>
                    <code>a</code>
                </mark>
                tag with your initials, with the class of "link" linking to the same page that it is on (referencing the current path is
                possible with "/").
            </p>
            <h2 id="part-3:-css-flex-layout">Part 3: CSS Flex Layout</h2>
            <p>Take a look at the header tag, with classes "header" and "center." This entire section is your page's header, which
                includes your logo, navigation, and other buttons. Think about how a header like this is laid out across the top of a
                page. What kinds of orientation would you need for its elements?</p>
            <pre><code class="language-html">&lt;header class="header center"&gt;</code></pre>
            <p>
                Within the
                <mark>
                    <code>styles.css</code>
                </mark>
                file, you'll find a class selector for the class
                <mark>
                    <code>center</code>
                </mark>. The intent of this class is to vertically center the children of elements of this class using a flex-box
                layout. Accomplish this task by adding the two necessary styles to achieve this.
            </p>
            <p>Underneath, there is also a class selector for the class
                <mark>
                    <code>header</code>
                </mark>. Because our header
                            in
                <mark>
                    <code>index.html</code>
                </mark>
                includes both classes "header" and "center," styling the "header" class will also cause stylistic changes on our header
                element. Recall that
                <code>
                    <mark>justify-content</mark>
                </code>
                is the attribute that pertains to manipulating elements in the horizontal direction in a flex-box context. Choose the
                style for
                <code>
                    <mark>justify-content</mark>
                </code>
                that you feel would best fit the look of the header tag and its children.
            </p>
            <div class="inline-img-container">
                <img
                    src="https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/OBGVr-DdHiQ2y9VOWuhXqXeGnFnyDSBTx7hv"
                    class="inline-img"
                    height="150px"
                    width="auto"/>
            </div>
            <h2 id="part-4:-basic-animation-with-css">Part 4: Basic Animation with CSS</h2>
            <p>You will now create a simple underline animation with CSS. You will notice that the styles in this section have a
                strange selector:</p>
            <pre><code>.link::before {
    content: "";
    display: inline;
    width: 0%;
    height: 0.2em;
    position: absolute;
    bottom: 0;
    background-color: var(--clr-primary);
    /* transition: */
}</code></pre>
            <p>The
                <mark>
                    <code>::before</code>
                </mark>
                selector is called a "pseudo-selector," which essentially just refers to a pseudo-element that exists before the
                selected element. You can give this pseudo-element an appearance by setting its
                <mark>
                    <code>display</code>
                </mark>
                to a specific attribute. In this case, we are using it to create our text underline. You'll notice now, if you try to
                hover the links on the header, you will see the underline, but it just appears instantly. We want to create this
                animation, so that it comes out from the left.</p>
            <p>The
                <mark>
                    <code>transition</code>
                </mark>
                property provides a way to control animation speed when changing CSS properties. Instead of having property changes take
                effect immediately, you can cause the changes in a property to take place over a period of time. Property changes are
                found in elements that have properties that change on certain actions, for instance hover (mouse over) and focus
                (selected). The property changes can be defined by
                <mark>
                    <code>:hover</code>
                </mark>
                and
                <mark>
                    <code>:focus</code>
                </mark>
                selectors as such:
            </p>
            <pre><code>.link:hover::before, .link:focus::before {
    width: 100%;
}</code></pre>
            <p>Observe that the way the underline appears. When the link is either hovered or selected, the width of the
                pseudo-element
                <mark>
                    <code>.link::before</code>
                </mark>
                changes to 100%, else it is 0 when it isn't hovered/selected. We want to animate this change. Fill in the transition
                style so that we achieve a smooth animation.</p>
            <pre><code class="language-css">transition: [property] [duration] [timing-function];</code></pre>
            <p>In the property section, you will want to target
                <code>
                    <mark>width</mark>
                </code>
                as mentioned previously. As
                            for the timing-function, you can use
                <mark>
                    <code>ease-in</code>
                </mark>, but there are many options available. Try playing around with the timing of the animation and see the results
                by hovering your links and logo!
            </p>
            <h2 id="part-5:-understanding-media-queries">Part 5: Understanding Media Queries</h2>
            <p>Some homework parts will involve analyzing parts of the skeleton code, so that you can understand its use cases.
                Answer the questions in the commented margins.
            </p>
            <pre><code class="language-html">&lt;button type="button" aria-label="toggle theme" class="btn btn--icon"&gt;
    &lt;i id="btn-theme" class="fas fa-moon"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/button&gt;</code></pre>
            <p>5.1: What does this button tag correspond to on the site?</p>
            <pre><code>&lt;button type="button" aria-label="toggle navigation" class="btn btn--icon nav__hamburger"&gt;
    &lt;i class="fas fa-bars"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/button&gt;</code></pre>
            <p>5.2: Try Ctrl-F in styles.css and look the class 'nav__hamburger'. You'll notice that it appears in 2 places. Why is
                one of the rules 'display: none' on one instance? How do you make it so that this button appears on screen? Hint:
                remember what @media (max-width: 600px) means.</p>
            <h2 id="part-6:-about-section">Part 6: About Section</h2>
            <p>Notice that the containing div for the section has two classes. The
                <mark>
                    <code>about__contact</code>
                </mark>
                class div underneath this part has already been filled in for you. You can ignore this for now.</p>
            <p>Your task is to create your name, role, and bio positioned front and center. To do so, you need to add an html
                element for each, one after the other:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    An

                    </code>
                    tag for your name. Try to make it in this format: "Hi, I'm" followed by your name in blue. (Hint: you can achieve this
                    using the
                    <mark>
                        <code>span</code>
                    </mark>
                    tag, which is designed to be nested within text-based elements to indicate a difference in style or some other function.
                    The class style
                    <mark>
                        <code>about__name</code>
                    </mark>
                    provides this coloring for you.)
                </li>
                <li>
                    An

                styling, namely how the flex display is oriented. Notice how your about section outer-div again has two classes: "about"
                and "center." Recall that the "center" class is the same class from the previous part, where it essentially sets
                <mark>
                    <code>display: flex;</code>
                </mark>
                and vertically centers the contents within the flex-box. Our about section, however, needs some additional formatting to
                display correctly. This will be done in the
                <mark>
                    <code>about</code>
                </mark>
                class. Fill in this style so that the contents in this
                            flex-box are arranged in a vertical fashion. Add a
                <code>
                    <mark>margin-top</mark>
                </code>
                if you'd like.</p>
            <h2 id="part-8:-project-section">Part 8: Project Section</h2>
            <p>For your project section, the skeleton code has created a
                <mark>
                    <code>div</code>
                </mark>
                with class
                <mark>
                    <code>project</code>
                </mark>
                which represents a card that describes each of your projects, including name, tech stack, and description. Try creating
                multiple copies of this div one after the other, and see how it displays on the browser. We want to preserve this "card"
                aspect to these project divs, and not have them stack in a long rectangular fashion repeatedly. To do so, we'll use
                something called a grid layout.
            </p>
            <h2 id="part-9:-css-grid-layout">Part 9: CSS Grid Layout</h2>
            <p>Given the following starter styles:</p>
            <pre><code>.projects__grid {
    max-width: 1100px;
    margin: 0 auto;
    /* display: */
    /* grid-template-columns: */
    /* grid-gap: */
}</code></pre>
            <!-- repeat(auto-fit, minmax(18em, 1fr)) -->
            <p>Fill in the missing styles to create a grid-like layout of the project cards. The style names should be fairly
                intuitive, but if you get stuck, it is always okay to look up CSS reference. No matter how experienced the developer, no
                one realistically knows every style by memory. Try different values for
                <mark>
                    <code>grid-template-columns</code>
                </mark>
                to see how this style works. You will notice that this style does not have a set number of arguments, but will take as
                many as you want columns. This can result in redundant code, so you can try using these CSS functions
                <mark>
                    <code>repeat()</code>
                </mark>
                and
                <mark>
                    <code>calc()</code>
                </mark>
                to handle this style, breaking the grid into rows of 3s. What is happening is essentially repeating a fixed calculation
                of width for each column in the grid. This calculation is derived from 1/3 of the parent div's width subtracted from
                your chosen
                <mark>
                    <code>grid-gap</code>
                </mark>*2/3 (since you will have 2 gaps between 3 cards in each row).
            </p>
            <pre><code class="language-css">grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, calc(100% / 3 - [your chosen grid-gap value] * 2 / 3));</code></pre>

                <mark>
                    <code>li</code>
                </mark>
                item with your skills and add
                            more as you see fit.</p>
            <h2 id="part-11:-More CSS Flex Layout">Part 11: More CSS Flex Layout</h2>
            <p>You may find it strange that we are applying a flex display to a list element. This is an acceptable use case of a
                flex-box layout, as a
                <mark>
                    <code>ul</code>
                </mark>
                element is simply another container element for
                            smaller
                <mark>
                    <code>li</code>
                </mark>
                elements. Fill in the styling for the
                <mark>
                    <code>skills__list</code>
                </mark>
                class selector given the following skeleton:
            </p>
            <pre><code>.skills__list {
    max-width: 450px;
    width: 95%;
    margin: 0 auto;
    /* display: */
    /* flex-wrap: */
    /* justify-content: */
}</code></pre>
            <p>Recall that
                <mark>
                    <code>justify-content</code>
                </mark>
                refers to orienting flex-box items horizontally, so we want to center these items. Further, take a look at
                the
                <mark>
                    <code>flex-wrap</code>
                </mark>
                attribute. This style can allow for a flex-box's child elements to wrap around into a new row (or column depending on
                the
                <code>
                    <mark>flex-direction</mark>
                </code>) if the width of the combined child elements exceeds that of
                            the flex-box.</p>
            <p>Now that the skills are oriented correctly, there are still some issues with the look of the skills section. The
                blocks seem too cramped, so we need to give them spacing between. You may remember that we used
                <mark>
                    <code>justify-content</code>
                </mark>
                to accomplish this task in the past. However, in this case, we want to control the amount of space between each element
                explicitly, and not rely on preset spacing. As such, we can simply manipulate each child element to have additional
                margins. Fill in the styling for the
                <mark>
                    <code>skills__list-item</code>
                </mark>
                class selector.
