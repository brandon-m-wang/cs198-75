header: "Project 2: Bullseye w/ Storyboard"
due: Fri, 2/18
introduction: >-
  Today we will be implementing the logic of Bullseye! This homework builds off
  of the knowledge from the lecture, but we will recap the basic concepts so
  don't worry if you forgot anything. For this homework we have implemented the
  UI for you using storyboards so you can focus solely on practicing swift.


  The core concept of it is that given a random number, you will try to move the slider to match the number, and the application will tell you if you're right or even close!


  Here is an example of the finished product:

setup: >-
  Throughout this course you will be pulling skeleton code from our github
  repos. To pull the skeleton code for bullseye, type this command below into
  your terminal on the directory you want the folder in.




  To open the project, open Xcode ‚Üí Open a Project or File ‚Üí Navigate to Bullseye

    paragraph: A storyboard is a visual representation of the UI of an app. As a
      developer you are able to manually place different elements of the app
      using ‚Äúdrag and drop‚Äù to build the UI.

    paragraph: In this course we will not be directly working with storyboards and
      will be working with SwiftUI instead. If you ever want to use storyboards
      you can change the `interface` setting to `storyboard` when creating a new
      project.

    paragraph: <h2 id="why-swiftui">Why SwiftUI?</h2>
  - type: ps
    paragraph: Although storyboards are intuitive when creating simple applications,
      storyboards become difficult to use when creating modern applications and
      it is in most cases more intuitive to use SwiftUI. SwiftUI is also
      becoming more and more popular in industry while storyboards are slowly
      becoming outdated.
  - type: ps
    paragraph: <h2 id="what-are-IBActions-and-IBOutlets">What are IBActions and
      IBOutlets?</h2>
  - type: ps
    paragraph: >-
      IBActions and IBOutlets result from connecting elements from a storyboard
      to actual code. For example, IBActions for buttons can be modified to
      perform a certain action when the button is tapped and IBOutlets for
      labels (text) can be modified to change how a piece of text appears on the
      screen. All IBActions and IBOutlets will be initialized for you. We would
      never use this with SwiftUI, but it is useful to know!


      This is how the IBActions and IBOutlets for this homework were initialized using Ctrl + click + drag

      With only these components it is very hard to get a bullseye.


      That is why we will add an exact switch! If the exact game mode is off, then we will have a range that is ¬±x where x is an integer so it will be a little easier to get a bullseye!

      First, let's add a switch:

  - type: ps
    paragraph: Then create an IB outlet called exactSwitch for it. We set it as an
      outlet and not an action, because the `Check?` button will check the
      property of the switch to see if it is on or off.

      Note that `Result Label` will be invisible (empty text) on your screen.
      This was purposely done and you will see why soon!


      Remember, the core concept of Bullseye is that given a random number, you're supposed to move the slider to try to match the number, and the application will tell you if you're right!


      **NOTE:**


      Please run the code on the iPhone 12 Pro ONLY. This is because of spacing issues which we will learn how to cover in future homeworks / lectures.

      <h2 id="exercise-2A-random-number">Exercise 2A: Random Number</h2>
  - type: ps
    paragraph: >-
      

      At the top under your IB outlets, go ahead and add a random number variable; this will be the value we try to match on the slider.
  - type: cbs
    codeblock:
      code: |-
        //at the very top after UIKit
        import Foundation

        var randomNumber = 0

        override func viewDidLoad() {
                super.viewDidLoad()
                randomNumber = Int(arc4random_uniform(101))
        				numLabel.text = String(randomNumber)
        }
      lang: swift
  - type: ps
    paragraph: >-
      Imported from Foundation, arc4random gives us a decimal number under 101,
      and wrapping it in Int converts it to an integer by rounding down to the
      nearest whole number, similar to the rounding we did to the slider number.
      We then set the random number in our viewDidLoad function.


      Notice how we used string interpolation to evaluate randomNumber within the text!


      Why is var randomNumber = 0 outside the function block rather than inside it?


      This has to do with a concept called scoping. By declaring the variable outside viewDidLoad(), other functions are able to access and modify randomNumber as well. If randomNumber were declared inside of viewDidLoad(), the variable would not be accessible inside other functions.


      Your application should now look like this:

  - type: ps
    paragraph: >-
      This is when we will begin to use the IB action function, checkValue.


      Our goal is to check if the randomNumber we generated is equal to the number of the slider, and if the number matches, we will have a label that says `Bullseye!`


      I will begin to write in pseudocode, because you have all the knowledge you need to write this :) Practice makes progress!

      This is where the exact switch comes in! If the exact game mode is off, then we will have a range that is ¬±3 so it will be a little easier to get a bullseye.


      We will use this exactSwitch condition in our checkValue function:


      if  exactSwitch.isOn is false, we run this set of statements based on the ¬±3 range


      if exactSwitch.isOn is true, we run our original if else statements where it decides based on if randomNumber = numSlider.value

      Now we should add a bit for functionality to make bullseye more fun!


      We will introduce the concept of levels. Users will start at level 1 and progress through increasingly harder levels as they hit the bullseye.


      To implement this functionality we will need to initially create new variables and initialize new labels in the viewDidLoad() function. Below your `randomNumber` variable, create two new variables. The `range` variable will allow us to keep track of the max range of the slider and the `level` variable will allow us to keep track of what level the user is on!

    paragraph: There is one more function we have to edit. You might‚Äôve noticed that
      when I missed the bullseye in the video above and pressed *`Play Again`*,
      the current level was still 2 and the range was still 150. We should add
      code so that when a user loses, the level will reset to 1 and the range
      will reset to 100.

      <h2 id="exercise-2F-high-score">Exercise 2F: High score</h2>
  - type: ps
    paragraph: >-
      <p>In this last exercise we will be implementing the high score
      functionality! I will not be showing you the code for this exercise, but
      will leave you with lots of hints.</p>

      <p>Note that implementing this is very similar and far less complicated than implementing levels.</p>

      <p>Hint 1: I created a new variable ‚Äúx‚Äù (name it however you want) to keep track of the high score similar to ‚Äúrange‚Äù and ‚Äúlevel‚Äù</p>

      <p>Hint 2: I initialized highScore.text to the ‚Äúx‚Äù in viewDidLoad()</p>

      <p>Hint 3: Whenever the playAgain() function was called I had an if statement with 2 conditions</p>

      <ol>

      <li>I checked if the current level was greater than the high score</li>

      <li>I also checked if the current level wasn‚Äôt equal to 1 since if the current level was equal to 1 that would mean that the user wasn‚Äôt able to pass the first level</li>

      </ol>

      <p>Hint 4: Inside the if statement I assigned the ‚Äúx‚Äù to be the current level and reassigned this to highScore.text</p>

      <p>Your app should look like this!</p>
