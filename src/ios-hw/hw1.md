title: hw1
header: "Project 1: Mobile Bookstore"
due: Fri, 2/11
introduction: Welcome to CS198-75! For your first homework, you‚Äôll be designing
  an iOS app that functions as a mobile bookstore. There will be no coding
  involved. This HW is simply to get you familiar with UI design using Figma and
  introduce you to common elements of iOS apps. You can expect the format of all
  released homeworks here on out to be in this guided doc format. Feel free to
  collaborate with your teammates on this homework, but remember that everyone
  has to submit their own homework.
setup: For this project (and all projects), you will have a project skeleton to
  work off of. Majority of the time, the skeleton will be actual code to pull
  from GitHub. However, since there is no code involved in this project, we have
  provided a link to a Figma template instead (later on). Please follow the
  instructions below. They will walk you through creating a Figma account and
  setting yourself up for the HW! If you have any trouble with the process,
  email jordan@calhacks.io. I‚Äôll try to help you out from there.

      <p>I‚Äôll go into the basics of Figma here that should be enough to get you started. A lot of it is pretty intuitive and gets easier with practice (as all things are). However, if you do get stuck or want to read more in depth on what you can do with Figma, I definitely recommend checking out this article: <a href="https://uxplanet.org/figma-all-you-need-to-know-156b52b88e54">https://uxplanet.org/figma-all-you-need-to-know-156b52b88e54</a></p>
