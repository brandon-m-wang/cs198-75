header: "Project 4: Waitlist Helper"
due: Fri, 3/4
introduction: Hello Hello! It’s Week 4 of Cubstart. Wooooo! Congrats for making
  it this far. Halfway point of homework :)). Hope you’ve been having fun and
  are learning a lot this semester. This week, your HW will be focusing creating
  multiple pages/screens in SwiftUI and navigating them with Swift. We will be
  mainly utilizing Navigation Views and Tab Views. The project we will be
  building is called Waitlist Helper. It will allow the user to input a waitlist
  position and class size, and then display a percentage chance of them getting
  into the class!
setup: For this project, you will be using some skeleton code that I wrote up to
  get you started. The file is pretty blank but the assets you need are there
  and the general setup is made for you. Don’t worry, like all homework, I’ll
  walk you through the entire project!
