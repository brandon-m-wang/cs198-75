header: "Project 6: Shopping List Part 2"
due: Fri, 4/1
introduction: Today we will be building on shopping list part 1! This homework
  builds off of the knowledge from the lecture, but we will recap the basic
  concepts so don't worry if you forgot anything. In the previous project we
  built a static shopping list app where the user wasn't able to add or delete
  items. In this project, we'll be implementing functionality for users to add
  or delete items in order to build a fully usable app!
setup: To pull the skeleton code for shopping list, type this command below into
  your terminal on the directory you want the folder in. To open the project,
  open Xcode → Open a Project or File → Navigate to Shopping List
skeleton: https://github.com/tonyhong007/shopping_list_part2
