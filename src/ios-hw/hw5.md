title: hw5
header: "Project 5: Shopping List Part 1"
due: Fri, 3/18
introduction: Today we will be implementing a static shopping list app! This
  homework builds off of the knowledge from the lecture, but we will recap the
  basic concepts so don't worry if you forgot anything. This project would
  essentially display a list of items that we need to buy and how many of each
  item we should buy. We'll be using lists and custom cells to display what we
  want with some dummy data. For this homework we'll be using dummy data but for
  next week's homework we'll be taking input from the user and displaying it on
  the screen!
setup: To pull the skeleton code for shopping list, type this command below into
  your terminal on the directory you want the folder in. To open the project,
  open Xcode → Open a Project or File → Navigate to Shopping List
skeleton: https://github.com/tonyhong007/shopping_list_part1
sections:
  - type: phs
    partheader: "Part 1: Setting up the Content View"
  - type: ps
    paragraph: <h2>What are Lists?</h2>
  - type: ps
    paragraph: Lists are a UI element in SwiftUI that allows you to display a table
      of data that a user can scroll through. A good example is the settings app
      on your phone! For this app we'll be taking advantage of the list element
      to display the items we need to buy.
  - type: ps
    paragraph: <h2>Creating a List</h2>
  - type: ps
    paragraph: >-
      We can initialize a list element with "List{}". The list will display any
      element that is placed within the brackets.


      Let's display one text element to have your code now look like this:
  - type: ibs
    imageblock: /assets/images/carbon.png
  - type: ps
    paragraph: Run it and see what it looks like!
