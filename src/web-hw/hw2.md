title: hw2
header: "Project 2: JavaScript Playground"
due: Fri, 2/18
introduction: This week's homework is intended to set you up for the more
  complex JavaScript-heavy projects to come in future weeks. Here, we'll go
  through the foundations and allow you to work with manipulating the DOM.
setup: For this project, there won't be any use of external libraries, so the
  skeleton simply includes the basic web file structure that we covered in
  lecture (HTML, CSS, JavaScript).
