title: hw5
header: "Project 5: Dijkstra's Algorithm Visualizer"
due: Fri, 3/11
introduction: For this project, you'll be building a visualization of the
  runtime of Dijkstra's algorithm on a user-generated maze. Dijkstra's algorithm
  is a pathfinding algorithm that finds the shortest path in a network of nodes
  and weighted edges between these nodes. For this project, you'll be building
  the example on an unweighted graph (a 2D grid), so it functions similarly to a
  BFS traversal, but the underlying JavaScript implementation of Dijkstra's is
  given to you for you to expand further and incorporate edge weights into the
  project if you wish. You do not need to understand how Dijkstra's works, as
  this project is an exercise on React states, props, and functional components.
setup: There are some dependencies you will need to install, but it will be
  covered in the first part of the homework.
