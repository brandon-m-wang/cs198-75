due: Fri, 3/18
introduction: Welcome to Homework 6! In this assignment, you'll be building your
  own video streaming application. Although this might seem intimidating, rest
  assured that we'll teach you all the steps that you'll need. The project can
  be roughly broken up into two parts. First, we have aNode.js server that will
  handle streaming the video and suppling other information. Second, we have a
  React client that will display the videos available and play a video selected.
setup: Get started by pulling from the skeleton repository below.
