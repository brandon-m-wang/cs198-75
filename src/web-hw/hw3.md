title: hw3
header: Caption Generation with Computer Vision
due: Fri, 2/25
introduction: In this homework, you'll be able to leverage the power of
  convolutional neural networks and APIs to build a novel web application that
  automatically generates captions based on the image contents! You'll be using
  TensorFlow's Common Objects in Context - Single Shot Detection (COCO-SSD)
  scheme to power your computer vision, and the OwlBot API to generate
  caption-like sentences of specific words.
setup: All external libraries needed will be covered in the homework parts.
