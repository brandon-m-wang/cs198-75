title: hw3
header: Caption Generation with Computer Vision
due: Fri, 2/25
introduction: >-
  In this homework, you'll be able to leverage the power of convolutional neural
  networks and APIs to build a novel web application that automatically
  generates captions based on the image contents! You'll be using TensorFlow's
  Common Objects in Context - Single Shot Detection (COCO-SSD) scheme to power
  your computer vision, and the OwlBot API to generate caption-like sentences of
  specific words.
