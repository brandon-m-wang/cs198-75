title: hw3
header: Caption Generation with Computer Vision
due: Fri, 2/25
introduction: >-
  In this homework, you'll be able to leverage the power of convolutional neural
  networks and APIs to build a novel web application that automatically
  generates captions based on the image contents! You'll be using TensorFlow's
  Common Objects in Context - Single Shot Detection (COCO-SSD) scheme to power
  your computer vision, and the OwlBot API to generate caption-like sentences of
  specific words.

setup: All external libraries needed will be covered in the homework parts.
skeleton: https://github.com/brandon-m-wang/cubstart-hw3-skeleton.git
sections:
  - type: phs
    partheader: Familiarize Yourself with the HTML and CSS
  - type: ps
    paragraph: Just take a quick second to skim through the provided HTML and CSS in
      the skeleton. Because this homework is focused on helping you get used to
      APIs and JavaScript, we have filled this in for you. It is still important
      to constantly brush up on fundamentals, and also to understand what you're
      going to target using JavaScript later on in the homework.
